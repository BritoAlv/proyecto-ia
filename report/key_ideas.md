# Key ideas (Search, Knowledge, NLP, Statistical analysis)

## Intro

- Intro 
- Main Problem and Hypothesis (Our hypothesis is that smart semaphores should improve the traffic in a the city)
- Problem modeling

## Implementation

- Discrete Event Simulation -> explanation/implementation
- A* -> explanation/implementation
- Fuzzy Logic -> explanation/implementation
- Semaphores/Cars/Walkers implementation

## Results

- What was done (for instance: we ran two simulations for two months, one with a standard semaphore, one with an intelligent semaphore)
- Data gathered
- Statistical analysis and results
- Conclusions drawn from the simulations (was the hypothesis ratified or rejected?)

## Further improvements
